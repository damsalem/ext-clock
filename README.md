# HMS Clock

## Hour-Minute-Second, Digital Clock

A chrome extension to display a clock with hours, minutes, and seconds.

I created this because I used to trade Options and I needed to know exactly when the market would open to the second, but having another tab open wasn't good and I used my phone to trade.

Having a Chrome Extension that displayed the full time digitally would have been perfect.

# Coding

Initially, I thought I'd need to use AlpineJS or some other framework to set the time, but I realized, just a bit of VanillaJS would likely take care of the whole thing.
